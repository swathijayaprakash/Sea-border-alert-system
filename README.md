# Sea-border-alert-system

we are creating 2 border alert system models here in our project. Its basically an IOT based project. one model is done using gps nad teh other model is done using RSSI.

1st sea border alert system using gps module

#######################################################

##components required:
Arduino uno
buzzer
12v DC motor
16 x 2 LCD Display 
Gps Module
Bread Board
adaptor
Jumperires for connecting the components.

## Steps to follow.
*so this arduino uno is a microcontroller which acts and a sandwich between the hardware and the software components.

*take a jumper wire and connect 5v power supply from arduino to bread board, now take another jumper and connect the ground terminal of arduino uno to breadboard again.

*we are doing this step, as we need power supply port and ground port for multiple components.

*refer the gps_module_connection.png image to connect the hardware part.

*once that connection is done, install arduino ide software and connect your arduino board 
with your Laptop[using USB AB cable] where you have installed the arduino ide software. 

* In arduino ide software go to ->tools ->board and make sure your arduino board is connected to teh software.

*copy paste the "sea border alert system using_gps_module" code in the software and upload the code to your arduino uno board[using USB AB cable].

############NOTE##############
I have used different border values according to my location, so kindly change the stored border values, according to your location and execute.
